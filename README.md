Advanced Cricket Stats with Natural Language Queries

## What It Does

CricGPT makes it easy to get advanced cricket statistics using natural language queries, leveraging [Statsguru](https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html). Whether you need simple player stats or complex comparisons across countries and opponents, CricGPT has you covered. Hereâ€™s what you can do with CricGPT:

- **Planner-Based Query Handling:** Breaks down complex queries into simpler ones, executes them, and combines the results into a neat table.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare team or player data across different years and countries with just a simple query.
- **Multiple Player Comparisons:** Compare multiple players side by side.
- **Name Handling:** Recognizes player name variations, including misspellings and abbreviations like "SKY" (Suryakumar Yadav) and "JFM" (Jake Fraser-McGurk).
- **Extra Info:** Provides a Cricinfo link to your search query for more details or to catch any mistakes made by the model.
